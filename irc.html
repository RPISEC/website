            <h2>What is IRC?</h2>
            <p><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">Internet Relay Chat</a> ("IRC") is a simple
                text-based communication system which allows for effective communication with a group of any size.</p>
            <p>As old and hacker-clich√© as it may be, IRC remains RPIESC's most active communications platform for
                current members and alumni alike.</p>

            <h2>Picking a Client</h2>
            <p>In order to use and chat over IRC, you need to install an IRC Client. Below is a list of typical IRC
                clients for the common platforms. Choose one and follow the relevant installation instructions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Windows - <a href="http://hexchat.github.io/">Hexchat</a>, <a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mIRC</a>,
                    <a href="http://xchat.org/">XChat</a></li>
                <li>Linux - <a href="http://hexchat.github.io/">Hexchat</a>, <a href="http://xchat.org/">XChat</a>, <a
                        href="http://www.irssi.org/">irssi</a> (advanced)
                </li>
                <li>macOS - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181001191451/http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more temporary IRC connections, we also recommend the web-based <a
                    href="https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.rpis.ec/#rpisec">KiwiIRC</a> client.</p>

            <h2>Getting Connected</h2>
            <p>Now that you have a client setup, all you have to do is connect to the RPISEC IRC server.</p>
            <p>With virtually all IRC clients you can add servers, and save their connection details. Below is what you
                should enter and save into your client's server list. Any other connection options can likely be left
                blank for now.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Server: <a href="ircs://irc.rpis.ec:6697/rpisec">irc.rpis.ec</a></li>
                <li>Port: <a href="ircs://irc.rpis.ec:6697/rpisec">6697</a> (SSL, 6667 for insecure)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you're connected to our server, join the main channel using the command below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>/join <a href="ircs://irc.rpis.ec:6697/rpisec">#rpisec</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you've made it this far, hopefully you should be sitting in our main channel! For a relatively small
                group, we almost always have some active discussion happening on a daily basis, especially during the
                school year.</p>

            <p>If things seem quiet or nobody responds to you within a minute or two, we are probably out and about.
                Just leave IRC open in the background and you will hear from someone soon enough.</p>
